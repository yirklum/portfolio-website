            <h1>About Full Stack Media Company</h1>
        </div>
    
        <div class="services-description">
            <img class="about-image" src="images/dc-at-twilight.jpg">
                    
            <div class="services-text">
                <p>At its core, Full Stack Media is a web development company. We create custom websites for clients who want 
                something unique. Rather than contorting your ideas to fit recycled templates from do-it-yourself website 
                services, let us build your vision from scratch.
                </p>

                <p>Full Stack Media was created in response to customer demand for individualized, affordable, integrated 
                website services. Our additional design, promotional and multimedia services 
                were added after our clients repeatedly asked for help with all the tasks that typically go with building a 
                website. Rather than try and coordinate a half a dozen entities (a web developer, a graphic designer, a 
                publicist, a photographer, a copywriter, etc.), people desired 
                a simpler solution. Full Stack Media provides customers with the convenience and affordability that comes 
                with bundling all the services they need. We create completely customized, integrated products that reflect 
                the particular needs of each client.
                </p>

                <p>Most of our customers are small businesses, nonprofits, or startups looking to establish themselves in 
                their particular arena.  And while Full Stack Media offers a wide range of services, it still operates like 
                a small business. This means each client receives one-on-one attention and prompt responses to any issues 
                they may have. Our employees have experience working in the private and governmental sectors in a variety of 
                fields, from web development and graphic design to public relations and media. 
                </p>   

                <p>Full Stack Media is based in Washington, D.C., but serves clients across the United States and abroad. 
                Most of our services do not require in-person meetings (although they are recommended for local clients). 
                Phone calls, e-mails and video-conferencing can easily facilitate back and forth communication. Contact us 
                today by e-mail at info@fullstackmediacompany.com or through our <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> for 
                a free consultation. Whether you’re a small business or individual looking to launch yourself or an 
                established entity ready for an image makeover, we’re ready and able to work with you. Tell us what you have
                in mind and we'll tell you how we can help! 
                </p>
