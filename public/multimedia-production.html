                    <p>While a simple website with well-written text and basic graphics is enough to meet the needs of many businesses, some clients desire a 
                        little something more. In a world of ubiquitous YouTube videos and attention grabbing podcasts, having multimedia elements can give a 
                        business a huge boost. Full Stack Media has the tools and the talent to assist you in creating, editing and distributing a variety of 
                        media. Our services include:</p>

                            <span class="small-title">Photography:</span>Nothing says “amateur website” like low-quality photographs. Snapping a few pictures 
                            on a phone – even adding a filter or two –may be sufficient for a Facebook post. However, high quality photos are an absolute 
                            necessity for any professional website. Our talented photographers will use state-of-the art cameras, lights and editing software 
                            to create the beautiful images that will represent you to the world. Whether you need headshots for a biography, candid shots of 
                            an event, or photos of your products, Full Stack Media can meet your needs. Furthermore, if you already have a photo – but it is 
                            not quite right – our editors can alter it to your satisfaction.

                            <span class="small-title">Video Production:</span>While photos and graphics are essential visual tools, some things can only be 
                            conveyed through video. From instructional videos to funny clips of animals, some things you just have to see play out. Adding 
                            video to a your website – or to other platforms, such as YouTube – is a great way to attract attention and hold interest. A 
                            charming welcome message or an illuminating product demonstration can connect to a customer in a way that text alone cannot. Full 
                            Stack Media has the tools and experience to produce high quality video content, letting you show your best side to your audience.

                            <span class="small-title">Podcasts:</span>The number of podcasts being produced has skyrocketed over the past couple of years. 
                            This is because podcasting can be a relatively easy and inexpensive way to reach a wider audience. Putting out a few 
                            well-produced episodes featuring compelling content can be much more effective than purchasing traditional advertisements. For 
                            those who want to create high quality content without investing in expensive equipment, Full Stack Media can produce your 
                            podcast for you. Our professionals will take care of set up, recording, editing and uploading—you literally only have to show up 
                            and talk!
